Potential is built on top of the Haskell Platform.
Requires GHC 6.12 and the Haskell Platform.  Download from:
        http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/

To build the standard library:
  $ cd libpotential
  $ cabal configure
  $ cable build
  $ cabal install

To build the compiler (this requires the standard library):
  $ cd compiler
  $ cabal configure
  $ cable build
  $ cabal install

This will install the Potential Standard Library into $HOME/.cabal/lib and the
Potential Compiler into $HOME/.cabal/bin.  ghc will be able to use the Potential
Standard Library without any changes to your system configuration; use of
the Potential Compiler will require you to explicitly reference $HOME/.cabal/bin/pc
or modify your system's PATH variable to include $HOME/.cabal/bin (which is highly
recommended).
